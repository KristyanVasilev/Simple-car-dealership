           <h3>Michelin Launches 'Motion For Life' Ad Campaign</h3>
           <p>The Michelin Group has launched its largest, multi-channel ad campaign in years. The company says its Motion For Life campaign "celebrates Michelin's role in facilitating the motion that is critical for life and human development.

            "The campaign’s concept highlights the breadth and diversity of the solutions Michelin offers around the world. From heavy industry to everyday transportation, recreation and travel, Michelin’s impact on mobility reaches across cultures and countries."
            
            The program includes ads filmed in nine locations around the world. (They can be viewed here.)
            
            "Renowned French advertising agency BETC designed the campaign, which will manifest across media not only in North America, but in every global region Michelin serves.
            
            "The common theme of the campaign is motion – of people, goods and ideas. Michelin is often associated exclusively with car tires, but the company’s reach goes far beyond. The campaign will demonstrate Michelin’s extensive range of solutions to make mobility safer, more enjoyable and more sustainable."
            
            “Michelin is a brand that represents motion,” says Edna Johnson, Michelin North America vice president of communication, brands and government affairs. “This campaign is about the role motion plays in the world, and how Michelin enables it in ways both obvious and not so obvious.”
            
            The ads will be seen across national television networks and streaming platforms in North America, beginning in May.</p>

            <h3>TESLA-Engine, Transmission, and Performance</h3>
            <p>Long Range Model Xs come standard with two electric motors—one at the front axle and one at the rear—which enables all-wheel-drive capability.
                 This setup is plenty swift and Tesla claims a zero-to-60-mph time of 3.8 seconds. 
                The 1020-hp three-motor Plaid high-performance variant is boasts a claimed zero-to-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds, but we haven't verified its acceleration times at our test track yet. Handling is respectable, 
                but the Model X's party trick is really the strong acceleration generated by its electric motors.</p>
