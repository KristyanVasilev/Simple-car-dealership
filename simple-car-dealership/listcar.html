            <h3>Audi's Grandsphere concept envisions autonomous vehicle as living room</h3>
            <p>According to Audi, the future of autonomous driving is ... reclined much of the time.

                The German premium brand on Thursday introduced the Grandsphere, the second of three planned concept vehicles it says lay out a future for its products as it transitions to an all-electric lineup that will include models with Level 4 autonomous-driving capability. Brand executives said they intend to sell a Level 4-capable vehicle to consumers by 2026. The first concept, named Skysphere, was shown last month; the Urbansphere will be shown next year.
                
                The Grandsphere, a large luxury sedan with two front-row seats and a rear bench, has two main highlights: the brand's coming cat-eye LED exterior lighting signature and a bespoke interior that reimagines how the vehicle's passengers will spend their time while the vehicle is driving itself.
                
                Accessed via large portal doors, the spacious Grandsphere interior replaces the traditional huge blackened touch screen prevalent in most such luxury vehicles with one projected across a wooden substructure that wraps across the vehicle from door to door. The wheel and control functions are hidden behind a hinged panel in the dashboard and emerge only on command from the driver. Most of the concept's functions are controlled by gesture, voice command or a distinct look from the driver that is picked up by the vehicle's sensors.</p>
 
             <h3>Audi's CEO sees volume doubling by 2030 in EV-dominated future</h3>
             <p>
                Audi's top executive said he believes the premium brand can nearly double its global sales volume to 3 million vehicles and maintain profit margins between 9 and 11 percent by 2030, even as it phases out internal combustion powertrains in favor of an all battery-electric lineup.
                
                Speaking to reporters via videoconference from headquarters in Ingolstadt, Germany, CEO Markus Duesmann admitted the brand's "Vorsprung 2030" strategy is ambitious but said he believes it is possible "in light of the market forecasts and our attractive product portfolio."
                
                He said that growing Volkswagen Group synergies — Audi now leads development of autonomous driving across the group and has responsibility for Lamborghini and Bentley — mean "a sustainable return of 11 percent is definitely realistic for us in the long term."
                
                In 2020, Audi sales were down 8.3 percent to 1,692,773 cars delivered worldwide compared with 2019. However, the brand gained market share in most major markets, including China, where it saw volume increase by 5.4 percent to a record 727,358..</p>
